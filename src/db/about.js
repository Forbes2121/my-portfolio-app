I'm a recent Thinkful graduate of their software engineering flex program. I am aspiring to be a full-stack developer. I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Economics from Colgate University.</p>
# About Me
I always love a good challenge. Whether that is solving a puzzle, strategizing in a board game, or competing out on the soccer field. I love being active and spending time outdoors hiking, running, biking, rollerblading, or snowboarding.</p>
Despite my love for the outdoors, I also enjoy video gaming, movies, TV, and the latest technology. I have grown to appreciate clean user interfaces that are both elegant and efficient.</p>
In my previous career within Finance as a front-office trader of US Treasuries, I was constantly looking for better software and technology to help make our jobs easier, more efficient, and also more profitable.</p>
